# Good Looking Cubes
This is a test of [gfx-hal](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx) I made a while back. It is a voxel ray-tracer. This project is no longer actively maintained, nor am I accepting any issues or PRs. This is simply for my own and other people's reference when working with gfx-hal in the future.

Screenshots:
